# Air Conditioner Simulator 2021 - Fuzzy System Demo
A basic simulation of an air conditioner, showing the basics of a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy System.
This was initially a project for my Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks class.
Everything is fully commented, and the release comes with Doxygen Documentation.
